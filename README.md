# D3-challenge
D3.js Monterrey Tech Data Analytics Boot Camp 2020

This is the assigment for D3.js where I developed a data visualization chart to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives using  charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand findings.

In this assingment I analyze correlation between health risks that are facing particular demographics. The source of the information is from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
The data set included with this assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

This data visualization was developed in two parts.  

First, in the StarterCode folder, please find the code for the chart that shows correlation only between poverty and lack of healthcare:

Second, the bonus part, where you find the intereactive chart for each of the demographics and behavioral risk factors:

In order to run both, Started Code version and Bonus version, first you would need to clone or download files from the green button in the top right corner of the github repo.

It is necessary to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
